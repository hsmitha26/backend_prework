## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
Conditional statements determine if an argument/operation is true or false.
Examples:
1 == 1 returns true
1 >= 3 returns false
1 == 1 || 1 != 1 returns true

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
One would use an if statement to make decisions based on user input.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
if (condition)
  puts (output)
else (condition is optional)
  puts (output)
end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
if (condition)
  puts (output)
    if (condition)
      puts (output)
    else (output)
    end
  else (condition is optional)
  puts (output)
end

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
if (condition)
  puts (output)
elseif (condition)
  puts (output)
else (condition is optional)
  puts (output)
end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
Make a comparison to see if the comparison is true or false.
'not equal to' is a useful operation to determine if a condition exists before proceeding with the rest of the operation.
