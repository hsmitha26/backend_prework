## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
A method can be a programmer designed set of instructions that can store values in variables.  That method can be called/used repeatedly throughout the program/globally or locally.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def  hello()
  puts "Sam I am"
end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
puts "#{hello_someone(Smitha)} I am"
1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
I don't know what I don't know.
I don't feel confident in my knowledge of methods.  I feel like I am guessing, I am not sure.
